<h1>Education system in India</h1>
<h2>About India</h2>
<div class="pure-g">
    <div class="pure-u-1-2"> 
        <pre>
<br>India, country that occupies the greater part of South Asia. 
Its capital is New Delhi, built in the 20th century 
just south of the historic hub of Old Delhi to 
serve as India's administrative centre. 

<br>Its government is a constitutional republic that represents 
a highly diverse population consisting of thousands of 
ethnic groups and likely hundreds of languages. 
With roughly one-sixth of the world's total population, 
India is the second most populous country, after China.

<h2> Illiteracy in India </h2>
<pre>In India, illiteracy is basically categorized as wide gaps between 
    rural and urban populations. The majority of the people 
    are illiterate especially in rural areas, where people are unaware 
    about the ill effects of being illiterate and moreover facilities 
    are also not ample.</pre>

<h2>Dropout rates in India</h2> 
<div id="dropout_rates">

<h2>Number of dropouts for primary and secondary students over the years</h2>

<div id="scatter">
</div>

<pre>
    <br>It has been revealed from the report that 
    there are 19 states/union territories where the dropout rate 
    at the secondary level (Class IX and X) is much higher 
    than the All India rate (17.3%). 
    
    <br>The dropout rate is more than 25% in Tripura, Sikkim, 
    Nagaland, Meghalaya, Madhya Pradesh, Assam, and Arunachal Pradesh. 
    In fact, four states have registered a dropout rate of 
    more than 30%.</pre>

        <h2>Percentage of schools with no resources.</h2>

        <pre id = "categories_text">
            <pre id = "box">Hover over the lines</pre> 

            <br>One of the major reasons why the dropout rate 
            is higher in economically backward regions is the 
            lack of resources. Lack of financial stability 
            forces people to look at education as luxury and 
            not necessity. 

            <br>Inadequate funds, unskilled teachers, 
            inadequate infrastructure, etc. contribute to 
            reasons for students leaving school. 
            This includes lack of facilities like computers, 
            and basic amenities like water and elctricity</pre>

        <pre id = "gender_text">

            <br>The lack of adequate toilets and proper hygiene
             in schools are major barriers to school 
             attendance and education of children, 
             specifically for girls. 
            
            <br>Children spend a significant part of their day 
            at school and the quality of water, 
            sanitation, hygiene (WASH) services at 
            the educational institution can impact 
            their learning and health.
            
            <br>Availability of quality WASH services at school 
            is also critical for the health and 
            dignity of girls. School dropout rate, 
            especially among girls, is  directly 
            linked to toilet and hygiene facilities 
            at schools.
