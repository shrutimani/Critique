        <h2>About India</h2>
        <pre>
<br>India, country that occupies the greater part of South Asia. 
Its capital is New Delhi, built in the 20th century 
just south of the historic hub of Old Delhi to 
serve as India's administrative centre. 

<br>Its government is a constitutional republic that represents 
a highly diverse population consisting of thousands of 
ethnic groups and likely hundreds of languages. 
With roughly one-sixth of the world's total population, 
India is the second most populous country, after China.

<h2> Illiteracy in India </h2>

    rural and urban populations. The majority of the people 
    are illiterate especially in rural areas, where people are unaware 
    about the ill effects of being illiterate and moreover facilities 
    are also not ample.</pre>

    at the secondary level (Class IX and X) is much higher 
    than the All India rate (17.3%). 
    
    <br>The dropout rate is more than 25% in Tripura, Sikkim, 
    Nagaland, Meghalaya, Madhya Pradesh, Assam, and Arunachal Pradesh.

        <pre>
            <br>One of the major reasons why the dropout rate 
            is higher in economically backward regions is the lack of resources. 
            Lack of financial stability forces people to look at education 
            as luxury and not necessity. 

            <br>Inadequate funds, unskilled teachers, inadequate infrastructure, etc. contribute to reasons 
            for students leaving school. 
            This includes lack of facilities like computers, and basic amenities 
            like water and elctricity</pre>
