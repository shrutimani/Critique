<h2>About India</h2>
<div class="pure-g">
    <div class="pure-u-1-2"> 
        <pre>
<br><strong id="bold-text">India</strong>, country that occupies the greater part of South Asia. 
Its capital is New Delhi, built in the 20th century 
just south of the historic hub of Old Delhi to 
serve as India's administrative centre. 

<pre id = "box">Hover over to see the population</pre> 
Its government is a constitutional republic that represents 
a highly diverse population consisting of thousands of 
ethnic groups and likely hundreds of languages. 
With roughly one-sixth of the world's total population, 
<strong id="bold-text">India</strong> is the second most populous country, after China.

<h2> Illiteracy in India </h2>
<pre id = "small"><br>In <strong id="bold-text">India</strong>, illiteracy is basically categorized as wide gaps between 
    rural and urban populations. The majority of the people 
    are illiterate especially in rural areas, where people are unaware 
    about the ill effects of being illiterate and moreover facilities 
    are also not ample.</pre>

<h2>Dropout rates in India</h2> 
<div id="dropout_rates">
</div>

<h2> Gross Enrolment Rate</h2>
<pre id = "small"><br>The gross enrollment rate (GER) is the total enrollment 
    in a specific level of education, regardless of age, 
    expressed as a percentage of the population 
    in the official age group corresponding to this level 
    of education. The GER can exceed <strong id="bold-text">100%</strong> because of early 
    or late entry and/or grade repetition.</pre>

<h2>Effect on primary and secondary students</h2>

<pre>
    <br>It has been revealed from the report that 
    there are 19 states/union territories where the dropout rate 
    at the secondary level (Class IX and X) is much higher 
    than the All <strong id="bold-text">India</strong> rate. 

   The dropout rate is more than <strong id="bold-text">25%</strong> in Tripura, Sikkim, 
    Nagaland, Meghalaya, Madhya Pradesh, Assam, and Arunachal Pradesh. 
    In fact, four states have registered a dropout rate of 
    more than <strong id="bold-text">30%</strong>.

            One of the major reasons why the dropout rate 
            is higher in economically backward regions is the 
            lack of resources. Lack of financial stability 
            forces people to look at education as luxury and 
            not necessity. 

            Inadequate funds, unskilled teachers, 
            inadequate infrastructure, etc. contribute to 
            reasons for students leaving school. 
            This includes lack of facilities like computers, 
            and basic amenities like water and electricity</pre>

        <pre>
            <pre id = "box">Hover over the bars</pre> 

             The lack of adequate toilets and proper hygiene
             in schools are major barriers to school 
             attendance and education of children, 
             specifically for girls. 
            
            Availability of quality hygiene (WASH) services 
            at school is also critical for the health and 
            dignity of girls. School dropout rate, 
            especially among girls, is  directly 
            linked to toilet and hygiene facilities 
            at schools.
